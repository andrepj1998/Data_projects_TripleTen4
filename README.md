# Tableau Project 2

## 🎯 Business Objective
I designed an interactive Tableau dashboard that explores key trends in book performance, reader engagement, and genre‑level insights. This project showcases my ability to transform raw data into a clear narrative that supports strategic decision‑making for publishers, authors, and marketing teams.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* tableau- Data Storytelling, EDA, ETL, Interactive Visuals, Calculated Fields, Data-driven Decision Making

## 💡 Key Insights & Business Impact
* Specific regions (e.g., West Coast) show high engagement but lower conversion rates compared to the Midwest.
* This highlights a logistics or pricing friction. The business should investigate if shipping costs or delivery times are higher in those regions, then test localized promotions or "Free Shipping" thresholds to convert that high interest into completed sales.
* A significant portion of total revenue is driven by a small number of high-performing genres (e.g., Fiction or Memoirs), while others show high volume but low margins.
* This allows the company to optimize inventory levels by prioritizing stock for high-margin genres and reducing warehouse costs for slow-moving categories.
